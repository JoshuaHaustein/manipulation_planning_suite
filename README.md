# manipulation_planning_suite
This repository contains a set of manipulation (currently only rearrangement) planning algorithms developed at RPL.
It is currently in its early stages of development. 

Available rearrangement planning algorithms:
- NaiveRRT (Standard kinodynamic RRT)
- HybridActionRRT (Kinodynamic RRT that utilizes action primitives to approximately solve the 2BVP)
- OracleRRT (Kinodynamic RRT that utilizes action primitives in the same way as SliceBasedOracleRRT to approximately solve the 2BVP)
- SliceOracleRRT (RRT-style planning algorithm that utilizes a slice view of the problem in combination with learned action primitives)

Parameters for each rearrangement planning algorithm:

**All**:
- timeout - maximum number of seconds to plan (reasonable value is 60s)
- weights - weights of individual entities (objects, robot) in distance function on search space (by default 1.0 for all)
- goal_bias - number in range [0,1] indicating how many times to attempt extending search tree to a goal (0.2 seems a reasonable value)
- target_bias - number in range [0, 1 - robot_bias] that biases the algorithm to attempt moving target objects (0.2 is reasonable again)
- robot_bias - number in range [0, 1 - target_bias] that biases the algorithm to attempt moving the robot (not as important as target_bias)
- object_weights_distance_fn - an optional map that may contain weights used in the distance function for each object. If the object is not in the map,
        the default value (1.0) is used. These weights are most relevant for HybridAtionRRT and OralceRRT (by choosing a small robot weight, these algorithm should become more similar to SliceOracleRRT)
       
**NaiveRRT**:
- num_control_samples - number of control samples

**HybridActionRRT**:
- num_control_samples - number of control samples, must be positive (within 10 is reasonable)
- action_noise - value in [0,1] that indicates randomness of action selection (0.5 is good)

**OracleRRT**:
- state_noise - probability to sample feasible state uniformly rather than from oracle (should be quite small)

**SliceOracleRRT**:
- do_slice_ball_projection - indiciates whether to project a sampled slice to reachable slice in the extension step
- max_pushing_distance - maximum distance an object can be pushed (set in Oracle)
- state_noise - probability to sample feasible state uniformly rather than from oracle (should be quite small, e.g. < 0.01)
- action_noise - probability to sample action uniformly rather than from oracle (should also be small, e.g. < 0.01)
